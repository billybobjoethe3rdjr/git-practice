# git-practice

## Story 1
Thank you for replying to my infuriating emails, willing to learn all of this.
I have finally worked out how all this works. 
Through multiple attempts, i worked out i did not redirect the location of my readme file. 
It was located in the ssh folder. 
I have now configured Git Bash to locate the readme file on the new folder located on my desktop.
I have edited this readme with both Notepad and with the Nano shortcut through Git Bash.
